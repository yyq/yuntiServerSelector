# yuntiServerSelector
If you use the vpn service from yunti and you are in the GreatWall, then you can use this script to help you select the best server for your network.
This scripted is tested with my OS X system.

# one more thing
Install your network service with yunti's helper, it will install a few ( L2TP and IKEv2 for each yunti server ) VPN services.

This script will stop your current connecting vpn service, ping find the best server, and start the best vpn connection for you.
